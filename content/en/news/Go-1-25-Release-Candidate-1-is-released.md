Hey fellow Gophers 👋,

Great news from the Go team — they’ve just released **Go 1.25rc1**, the first **release candidate** for Go 1.25! This is a perfect time for us developers to try it out, run our unit tests, and help the Go team ensure a smooth final release.

I’ve taken a first look at the release candidate, and here’s everything you need to know.

---

## 📥 How to Install Go 1.25rc1

If you already have Go installed, you can try the new version easily using the Go toolchain:

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/go1.25rc1@latest
go1.25rc1 download
```

This installs `go1.25rc1` as a separate binary, so it won’t mess with your current setup.

Prefer downloading manually? You can grab the binaries or source code directly from the official downloads page:

👉 [Download Go 1.25rc1](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.25rc1)

## 🔎 What's New in Go 1.25?

While the final release notes aren’t out yet, the **draft release notes** give a solid overview of what's coming:

📄 [Go 1.25 Draft Release Notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.25)

Some key areas to look out for:

* Compiler and runtime performance improvements
* Continued enhancements to the garbage collector and linker
* More refined error messages and tooling upgrades
* Small but meaningful updates to the standard library

I'll be digging deeper into these over the next few days and will share any cool discoveries I come across.

## 🧪 Why You Should Test It

If you maintain any Go services, libraries, or tools, **now is the time to test**. Running your code against the release candidate can help:

* Spot regressions early
* Catch breaking changes (if any)
* Improve Go’s final release quality by reporting issues

You can report any problems using the official Go issue tracker here:

## 🗓️ What’s Next?

This is just the release candidate, so the **final Go 1.25 release is still around the corner**. Based on past schedules, it usually follows in a few weeks, assuming no major blockers.

Until then, give `go1.25rc1` a spin, and let’s help polish it for prime time.
