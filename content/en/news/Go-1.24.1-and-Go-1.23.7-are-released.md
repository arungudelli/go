`Go` language team at Google released two minor versions `Go 1.20.2` and `Go 1.23.7` on 07-03-2023.

As part of these releases, `Go` language team fixed following minor security issue.

1. **CVE-2025-22870**: `net/http`, `x/net/proxy`, `x/net/http/httpproxy`: proxy bypass using IPv6 zone IDs .


## **CVE-2025-22870**: `net/http`, `x/net/proxy`, `x/net/http/httpproxy`: proxy bypass using IPv6 zone IDs.

Matching hosts against proxy patterns could mistakenly interpret an IPv6 zone ID as part of the hostname. 

For instance, if the NO_PROXY environment variable was set to "*.example.com", a request to "[::1%25.example.com]:80" would be incorrectly matched and bypass the proxy.

This issue reported by [Juho ForsÃ©n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jupenur/) who works at Mattermost.

This issue tracked by CVE-2025-22870.
