Here after it's advisable to build and install packages in module mode using `go install` command (with or without a version).

And the use of `go get` command to build and install packages is deprecated.

`go get` should be used with the flag `-d` for current module's dependencies without building the packages.

In future releases this flag will be enabled by default.663           iiiihi gh gh
