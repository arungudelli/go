A Code editor is a basic programming tool, where we will write and edit program's source code.

In this article I will be listing down code editors,plugins and IDEs(Integrated Development Environment) for Go langauge.

Let's not argue which one to use.

The choice of a code editor or IDE depends on your projects and personal preferences.

I prefer using open source Visual Studio Code IDE for Go Language.

Goland is also a good alternative but commercial one.
