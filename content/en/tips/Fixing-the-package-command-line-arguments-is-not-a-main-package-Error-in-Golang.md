## **Introduction**  

While learning Go, I encountered an interesting error:  

```
package command-line-arguments is not a main package
```  

At first, it was a bit confusing. I had written a simple Go program, but when I tried to run it, this error popped up. 

After some digging, I figured out what was happening, why this error occurs, and how to fix it. 

Iâ€™m sharing my learning experience here so that if you ever run into this issue, youâ€™ll know exactly how to solve it.

## **How I Got This Error**  

I was experimenting with Go and wrote a basic program like this:  

```go
package mypackage

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

Then, I tried to run it using:  

```sh
go run example.go
```

And boom! I got this error:  

```
package command-line-arguments is not a main package
```

At first, I wasnâ€™t sure what this meant.

But after some research, I learned that this happens when Go doesnâ€™t recognize the file as part of an executable package.

---

## **Why This Error Happens**  

Hereâ€™s what I figured out:  

- The Go compiler expects an executable program to belong to the `main` package.  
- Since I named my package `mypackage`, Go didnâ€™t treat it as a runnable program.  
- When using `go run`, Go compiles the file into a temporary binary and assigns it the name `command-line-arguments`. 

But if itâ€™s not a `main` package, it fails to generate an executable, leading to this error.

## **How I Fixed It**  

### âœ… **Solution 1: Changing the Package to `main`** 

To fix the issue, I changed my code like this:  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

Now, when I ran:  

```sh
go run example.go
```

It worked perfectly! ðŸŽ‰  

### âœ… **Solution 2: Using `go build` for Other Packages**  
Later, I realized that if I wanted to structure my project with multiple packages, I shouldnâ€™t use `go run` directly on non-main packages.  

For example, if I have a project like this:  

```
myproject/
â”‚â”€â”€ main.go
â””â”€â”€ mypackage/
    â”œâ”€â”€ mypackage.go
```

Where `mypackage.go` contains:  

```go
package mypackage

import "fmt"

func PrintMessage() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from mypackage!")
}
```

And `main.go` contains:  

```go
package main

import (
    "mypackage"
)

func main() {
    mypackage.PrintMessage()
}
```

I learned that instead of using `go run`, I should build and run it like this:  

```sh
go build -o myapp main.go
./myapp
```

This approach ensures that Go recognizes my packages properly and doesnâ€™t assign `command-line-arguments` as the package name.

---

## **Final Thoughts**  

This was a great learning experience for me.

I realized that Go has strict rules about package names, and understanding them helped me avoid this error in the future. 

The key takeaways are:  

âœ… Always use `package main` when writing an executable Go program.  
âœ… Use `go build` instead of `go run` when working with multiple packages.  
âœ… `command-line-arguments` is just a temporary name Go gives to files that donâ€™t belong to a proper package.  

I hope my learning helps you avoid this confusion when working with Go. Happy coding! ðŸš€
